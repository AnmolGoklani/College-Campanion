THE ROCKY ROAD:

Our journey was no walk in the park. All of us were complete WebD noobs, and this project was our wild way of diving headfirst into the tech world. We dreamed of a cool NoSQL database with MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and Mongoose for user accounts, but due to time constraints we had to settle for a simple login setup.

To ensure your data doesn't disappear every time you refresh a page, we had to resort to storing it in your local storage. It wasn't the dream setup, but it got the job done.

In the end, we powered through the challenges, and we're proud to present a project that's as cool as it is functional.
