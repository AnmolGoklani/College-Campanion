            <h2>Choreo Section</h2>
            <p>The Choreography and Dance section is one of the most glamorous
sections in the cultural council. After their collaboration with Cinesec
IITR (the viral rendition of Ed Sheeran's Shape of you), they are rather
well known. Apart from that, their performances in Footloose are
something you wouldn't want to miss. The audience participation in
their performances is overwhelming. The countless hours spent
practising and perfecting every step are quite evident from their
exhilarating performances in Footloose and Jashn. The wide array of
dance forms covered shows the diversity and versatility of the group.

        <div id="musicSectionInfo" class="club-info" style="display: none;">
            <h2>Music Section</h2>
            <p>The Music section IITR is a group of talented musicians that satiates our
needs for live music in a town like Roorkee where live music is a rare
find. The music covered is diverse with an Indian classical music show -
Swaranjali and a western music(progressive rock, jazz & blues) show -
Dhun, there is something for everyone. Music covered includes songs by
Porcupine Tree, Queen, Pink Floyd, Snarky Puppy, AR Rahman,
Thaikkudam Bridge and various Coke Studio compositions. The practice
sessions are rigorous, as is evident from the enthralling performances.
Since it is a performing section, there is a threshold for the skill set
required to join the section. Instrumentalists are expected to be able to
play with others and improvise. A basic understanding of music theory
gives an edge but isn’t a necessity. For percussionists, being able to play
basic time signatures and keeping time is enough to get through the
recruitments. Vocalists should be able to sing in tune and hold a note
properly. Being able to sing harmonies helps a ton..</p>
